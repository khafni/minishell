# minishell

a (pseudo) bash clone reimplementation from scratch without a parser generator because why not?

## that supports:
    - pipes
    - redirections (>> , <, >, <<)
    - single and double quotes handeling
    - env variables expansion
    - reimplementation of several commands (echo, cd, pwd, exit, export, unset)
    - signals
    - exit status

this was a group project was made by me and [ayoub abounakif](github.com/ayoubabounakif)
